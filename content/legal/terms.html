            <p>
              SBOS is a B2B software platform designed to assist small businesses with operational management. Features include, but are not limited to, business operational assessments, Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) management, KPI tracking, team management, and AI-powered content generation.

Any such personalized advisory services are separate from this Service and require a distinct written agreement with Stintwell LLC.
