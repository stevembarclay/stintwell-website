          </p>

          <p>
            Note: This policy covers the use of our software platform (SBOS) and website. Custom strategic advisory services or consulting engagements are distinct services governed by separate agreements and are not covered by the scope of this platform policy unless explicitly stated.

            This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, retain, and protect information in connection with our website, platform, tools, and consulting engagements. It also describes the rights available to you under applicable U.S. and Canadian privacy laws.
          </p>
